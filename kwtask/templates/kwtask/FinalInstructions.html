        On the following pages, there are several situations, all dealing with decisions that Individual A,
        a participant in an experiment, might have to make.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each situation, the you will read the description of the situation. You will then indicate your
        appropriateness rating by placing a check mark in the corresponding box.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the experiment today, we will randomly select one of the situations. For this situation, we
        will also randomly select one of the possible choices that Individual A could make. Thus, we will select
        both a situation and one possible choice at random. For the choice selected, we will determine which response
        was selected by the most people in the experiment today. If you give the same response as that most frequently
        given by other people, then you will receive an additional {{ Constants.bonus }}. This amount will be paid
        to you at the conclusion of the experiment. For instance, if we were to select the example situation above and
        the possible choice "Leave the wallet where it is," and if your response had been "somewhat socially
        inappropriate," then you would receive {{ Constants.bonus }}, in addition to the {{ participation_fee }}
        participation fee, if this was the response selected by most other people in today's session.
        Otherwise you would receive only the {{ participation_fee }} participation fee.
