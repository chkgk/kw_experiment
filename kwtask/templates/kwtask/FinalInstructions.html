        The following screen page shows the relevant situation, dealing with decisions that Individual A,
        a participant in an experiment, might have to make.

        Read the description of the situation. Then indicate your
        appropriateness rating by selecting the button for each of their choices.

            At the end of the experiment today, will randomly select one of the possible choices that Individual A could
            make. For the selected choice, we will determine which response was selected by the most people in the
            experiment today. If you give the same response as that most frequently given by other people, then you will
            receive an additional {{ Constants.bonus }}. This amount will be paid to you at the conclusion of the
            experiment. For instance, if we were to select the example situation above and the possible choice "Leave the
            wallet where it is," and if your response had been "somewhat socially inappropriate," then you would receive
            {{ Constants.bonus }}, in addition to the {{ participation_fee }} participation fee, if this was the response
            selected by most other people in today's session. Otherwise you would receive only the {{ participation_fee }}
            participation fee.
