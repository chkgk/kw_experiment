    <p>
        On the following screens, you will read the description of a situation. In the situation, one person,
        "Individual A", must make a decision. You will be given a description of the decision faced by Individual A.
        This description will include several possible choices available to Individual A.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you read the description of the decision, you will be asked to evaluate the different possible choices
        available to Individual A and to decide, for each of the possible actions, whether taking that action would be
        "socially appropriate" and "consistent with moral or proper social behavior" or "socially inappropriate" and
        "inconsistent with moral or proper social behavior." By socially appropriate, we mean behavior that most people
        agree is the "correct" or "ethical" thing to do. Another way to think about what we mean is that if Individual
        A were to select a socially inappropriate choice, then someone else might be angry at Individual A for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each of your responses, we would like you to answer as truthfully as possible, based on your opinions of
        what constitutes socially appropriate or socially inappropriate behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give you an idea of how the study will proceed, we will go through an example and show you how you will
        indicate your responses. On the next screen you will see an example of a situation.
