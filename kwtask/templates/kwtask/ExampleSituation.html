        Individual A is at a local coffee shop near university campus. While there, individual A notices that someone has left a
        wallet at one of the tables. Individual A must decide what to do. Individual A has four possible choices:
        take the wallet, ask others nearby if the wallet belongs to them, leave the wallet where it is, or give the
        wallet to the shop manager. Individual A can choose one of these four options.

            The table below presents a list of the possible choices available to Individual A. For each of the choices,
            you will be asked to indicate whether most people would believe that option to be very socially inappropriate,
            socially inappropriate, somewhat socially inappropriate, somewhat socially appropriate, socially appropriate, 
            or very socially appropriate. To indicate your response, you would select the corresponding button. 
            Note: In this example, the buttons are disabled.
