        Individual A is at a local coffee shop near university campus. While there, individual A notices that someone has left a
        wallet at one of the tables. Individual A must decide what to do. Individual A has four possible choices:
        take the wallet, ask others nearby if the wallet belongs to them, leave the wallet where it is, or give the
        wallet to the shop manager. Individual A can choose one of these four options.
    </p>
    <p class="italics">
        The table below presents a list of the possible choices available to Individual A. For each of the choices,
        you will be asked to indicate whether you believe choosing that option is very socially inappropriate,
        somewhat socially inappropriate, somewhat socially appropriate, or very socially appropriate. To indicate
        your response, you would select the corresponding button. Note: In this example, the buttons are disabled.

        If this were the situation for this study, you would consider each of the possible choices above individually
        and, for each choice, indicate the extent to which you believe taking that action would be "socially appropriate"
        and "consistent with moral or proper social behavior" or "socially inappropriate" and "inconsistent with moral
        or proper social behavior". Recall that by socially appropriate we mean behavior that most people agree is
        the "correct" or "ethical" thing to do.
